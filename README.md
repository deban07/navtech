I have added two section as per the reqirment - 1. Admin 2.User

If we go for Admin , we can add shoe size and procing which will be stored on app storage by AsyncStorage . If you get back and enter in to the user section there we can see the total number of intems or shoes at present.

rest of the functionality is pending.

Thanks
